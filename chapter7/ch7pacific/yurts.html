    <h2>The yurts at Pacific Trails</h2>
<section>
    <h3>What is a yurt?</h3>
    <p>
        Our luxury yurts are permanent structures four feet off the ground. 
        Each yurt is fully enclosed with canvas walls, a wooden floor, and a roof dome that can be opened.
    </p>

<section>
    <h3>How are the yurts finished?</h3>
    <p>
        Each yurt is furnished with a queen-size bed with a down quilt and a gas-fired stove. 
        Your luxury camping experience includes electricity and a sink with hot and cold running water. 
        Shower and restroom facilities are located in the lodge.

    <h3>What should I bring?</h3>
    <p>
        Most guests pack comfortable walking shoes and plan to dress for changing weather with light layers of clothing. 
        It's also helpful to bring a flashlight and a sense of adventure!
